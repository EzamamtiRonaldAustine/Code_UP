\section*{Question One: Implementation Progress of Uganda Towards SDGs}
\onehalfspacing
\setstretch{1.15}
Uganda has made notable progress in implementing the Sustainable Development Goals \cite{sdg2023}, particularly SDGs 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 11, and 13. The integration of these goals into frameworks like Uganda Vision 2040 and the National Development Plans (NDPs) highlights the country's commitment to sustainable growth.

\subsection*{SDG 1: No Poverty}
The Parish Development Model (PDM), launched in 2022, aims to transition 3.5 million households from subsistence farming to commercial agriculture. Previous initiatives, such as "Prosperity for All" (2007)\cite {ndpiv2025}, faced challenges. The Social Assistance Grants for Empowerment (SAGE), piloted in 2011 and expanded in 2015/16, provides cash transfers to elderly Ugandans, enhancing financial security.

\subsection*{SDG 2: Zero Hunger}
Uganda promotes climate-smart agriculture, focusing on climate change adaptation. The National Agricultural Advisory Services (NAADS), established in 2001, offers extension services and inputs. Expanded school feeding programs support child nutrition and benefit local farmers.

\subsection*{SDG 3: Good Health and Well-being}
Progress in maternal and child health has been achieved through improved antenatal care and immunization. Uganda is also expanding health centers in rural areas to address inequities.

\subsection*{SDG 5: Gender Equality}
Female representation in politics has increased since the 1995 constitution. The "Spotlight Initiative," launched in 2019, aims to combat gender-based violence (GBV) by strengthening legal frameworks and community engagement.

\subsection*{SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth}
Infrastructure development has accelerated, with significant investments in roads, energy, and communications. The youth skilling programs and vocational training centers are also expanding.

\subsection*{SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities}
Urban planning focuses on waste management, sanitation, and transportation. The KCCA is upgrading drainage and waste collection to mitigate flooding, while affordable housing projects address deficits for low-income populations.

\subsection*{SDG 13: Climate Action}
Uganda has implemented reforestation programs and invested in renewable energy sources like solar. Climate adaptation strategies support farmers with water harvesting techniques and drought-resistant crops.

\section*{Question Two: Uganda National Development Plan 4 (2025-2030)}
\subsection*{(a) Five Strategic Objectives}
The Uganda National Development Plan IV (NDP IV) for 2025–2030 outlines five strategic objectives aimed at promoting economic growth and socio-economic transformation. As a computer scientist, I can employ my expertise to contribute positively to each of these objectives through innovative technological solutions.

\subsection*{Strategic Objectives and Contributions}

\subsubsection*{1. Sustainably Increase Production, Productivity, and Value Addition in Key Sectors}
\begin{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Blockchain-Based Identity Management:} Utilizing blockchain for identity management to strengthen national security and improve land governance.
\end{itemize}

\section*{(b)Research Contributions to Strategic Objectives}

\subsection*{Objective Selected: Strengthen Good Governance, Security, and the Role of the State in Development}

\subsubsection*{i. Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Fraud Detection:} Employing AI-based predictive analytics to identify fraudulent activities and corruption patterns within public administration.
    \item \textbf{Natural Language Processing (NLP):} Utilizing NLP applications to facilitate efficient communication between citizens and government entities.
    \item \textbf{Risk Assessment Models:} Developing AI-driven risk models to enhance decision-making in national security.
\end{itemize}

\section*{(c) Proposed Project in Embedded Systems and Robotics field}

\subsection*{Project Title: Blockchain Technology for Transparent Land Ownership in Uganda}

\subsection*{Problem Statement}
Uganda’s land administration system suffers from inefficiencies due to manual processes, poor record-keeping, and corruption. Although the National Land Information System (NLIS) was introduced, fraudulent transactions, bribery, and document forgery remain rampant \cite{rugadya2020}. An estimated 80\% of land remains undocumented, leading to disputes, forced displacements, and social unrest \cite{krigsholm2021}. A blockchain-based embedded system offers a secure, tamper-proof solution to enhance transparency, security, and accessibility in Uganda’s land governance framework \cite{ncube2022}.

\subsection*{Project Objectives}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Analyze inefficiencies in Uganda’s land administration system, focusing on transparency, security, and bureaucratic delays.
    \item Develop a blockchain-integrated embedded system that securely records and verifies land transactions, preventing fraud.
    \item Implement smart contracts to automate land transfers, reducing corruption and eliminating manual processing delays.
    \item Assess the feasibility and impact of blockchain adoption within Uganda’s legal and technological landscape.
\end{itemize}
