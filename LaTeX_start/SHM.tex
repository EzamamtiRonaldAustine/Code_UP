\chapter[CHAPTER ONE INTRODUCTION]{CHAPTER ONE\\INTRODUCTION}

\section{Background}

\noindent Home management and security remained critical concerns across Uganda, with modern households seeking integrated solutions that enhanced both safety and quality of life. Recent crime statistics from the Uganda Police Force revealed ongoing security challenges, while the evolution of smart home technology presented opportunities for comprehensive household management that went beyond traditional security measures.

\noindent According to the Annual Crime Report 2024, while theft incidents decreased by 6.6 percent from 65,901 cases in 2023 to 61,529 cases in 2024, the need for proactive home management solutions extended beyond security to encompass comfort, convenience, and energy efficiency. The 30\% of Uganda's population now residing in urban areas (15,430,672 people in 2025) faced unique challenges in managing modern homes that required integrated approaches to security, environmental control, and user convenience.

\noindent Contemporary home management challenges included the need for seamless integration of multiple systems such as access control, environmental monitoring, lighting management, and security alerts. Traditional approaches often involved separate systems that operated independently, creating complexity for users and limiting the potential for intelligent automation and energy optimization.

\noindent This project was developed during a five-week embedded systems internship at Uganda Industrial Research Institute (UIRI), recognizing that Uganda's evolving urban landscape required innovative approaches to home management that combined modern technology with local accessibility. By leveraging readily available components and open-source technologies, this project demonstrated how locally-developed innovation could address comprehensive home management challenges while contributing to Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 9 (Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure) and 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities).

\section{Problem Statement}

\noindent Modern urban households in Uganda faced fragmented home management systems that failed to provide integrated solutions for security, comfort, and convenience. While individual security measures, environmental controls, and lighting systems existed, they typically operated as isolated components requiring separate management interfaces and lacking intelligent automation capabilities.

\noindent The fundamental challenge lay in the absence of affordable, comprehensive home management systems that could integrate multiple household functions while remaining accessible to average Ugandan households. Commercial smart home solutions typically required investments exceeding UGX 3,000,000 for comprehensive installation, while existing DIY approaches lacked the integration and user-friendly interfaces necessary for effective home management.

\noindent Current home management approaches suffered from several limitations: security systems that only provided basic intrusion detection without environmental integration, lighting controls that lacked automation and energy optimization, climate control systems that operated without intelligent scheduling, and access control methods that required physical presence without remote management capabilities.

\noindent Urban households needed integrated systems that could provide automated access control, intelligent environmental management, energy-efficient lighting control, real-time security monitoring, and remote management capabilities through intuitive interfaces. These systems must be economically accessible, technically manageable for users with varying technical backgrounds, and adaptable to Uganda's infrastructure conditions including inconsistent power supply and variable internet connectivity.

\noindent This situation created an urgent requirement for innovative, cost-effective home management solutions that could bridge the gap between basic home controls and comprehensive smart home automation, enhancing both security and quality of life for urban households.
\newpage
